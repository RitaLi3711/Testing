                <h3 class="faq-question">Why do cookies spread & flatten?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">There are a few main reasons for this that I have found in my experience:</p>

                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li class="list-item numbered">
                        <strong>Expired leavening agents.</strong> If your baking soda or baking powder are past their
                        prime, your chocolate chip cookies will likely flatten and spread.
                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <p class="tip-text"><span class="highlight">How to test baking soda:</span> Combine 1/2 cup
                                hot water, 1/4 teaspoon vinegar and 1/4 tsp baking soda. It should bubble immediately.
                            </p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Why didn't my cookies flatten?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">If your cookies didn't flatten, here are a few things that could've been the
                    problem:</p>

                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li class="list-item numbered">The ingredients/cookie dough was too cold. Cold dough doesn't spread
                        as well.</li>
                    <li class="list-item numbered">You accidentally used too much flour. Be sure to measure correctly by
                        scooping and leveling.</li>
                    <li class="list-item numbered">The butter/sugar mixture wasn't fully creamed. Try creaming for
                        longer.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can you bake chocolate chip cookie dough from frozen?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes! I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can count. I
                    have gotten the best results when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat
                    the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in
                    the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the
                    cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still
                    taste amazing.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I halve this recipe?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, this recipe halves easily. Simply decrease the ingredients by half and the
                    recipe will make 18 cookies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I add nuts to this recipe?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, you can add walnuts or pecans with great success. Simply decrease the amount
                    of chocolate chips slightly to accommodate the extra nuts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I substitute ingredients?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The only ingredient I feel confident that can be changed up is the mix-ins.
                    Chocolate chips, sprinkles, peanut butter chips, etc. Do not change anything else in this recipe.
                    However, here are some tested substitutions:</p>

                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li class="list-item bullet"><strong>Butter:</strong> Salted or unsalted both work. Just taste the
                        dough!</li>
                    <li class="list-item bullet"><strong>White Sugar:</strong> Granulated white sugar or organic cane
                        sugar.</li>
                    <li class="list-item bullet"><strong>Sea Salt:</strong> If using table salt, start with 1/2 tsp and
                        adjust to taste.</li>
                    <li class="list-item bullet"><strong>Chocolate Chips:</strong> Use chocolate chunks, chopped
                        chocolate, or chips - just use 2 cups total.</li>
                </ul>
