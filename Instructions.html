                <p class="step-text">The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies is to combine the dry
                    ingredients in a medium size bowl. When doing this, make sure to measure the flour correctly. Be
                    sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then,
                    measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and leveling it with a knife.</p>

            <div class="instruction-step">
                <p class="step-text">Next, cream together butter and sugars. Make sure to soften the butter early by
                    taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it's ready to go when you need it.
                    You can also warm it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it. Once
                    butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</p>

                    at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.</p>

                <p class="step-text">Once the cookie dough is finished, it's time to portion and roll the dough. I know
                    many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop. Using a
                    cookie scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. I love this
                    stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies. At this point you can either bake
                    your dough or freeze it.</p>

            <div class="instruction-step">
                <p class="step-text">Since this chocolate chip cookie recipe makes so many cookies, I always make a full
                    batch and freeze some. That way I have dough on hand for unexpected guests or whenever the cookie
                    craving strikes. I prefer to flash-freeze the cookie dough before putting it in an airtight
                    container. To do this, roll the cookie dough into balls and space them out on a parchment lined
                    baking sheet. Then put the baking sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the dough
                    slightly freezes. Once the dough is slightly frozen, transfer the cookie dough balls to an airtight
                    container or plastic bag and freeze for up to 2 months.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">How to Bake Frozen Dough</h2>

            <p class="step-text">There are two ways to bake frozen dough:</p>

            <ol class="numbered-list">
                <li class="list-item numbered">Thaw it first: I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for
                    impromptu guests. When you want to bake them, remove the dough balls from the freezer, set them on a
                    parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw. Then,
                    once they reach room temperature (after about 1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your
                    kitchen) bake as directed in the recipe (at 375 degrees F). SO easy!</li>
                <li class="list-item numbered">Bake from frozen: Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet.
                    Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put
                    the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as
                    you preheat it). Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will
                    look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.</li>
            </ol>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Bake Until they just barely look done</h2>

            <div class="instruction-step">
                <p class="step-text">If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them
                    evenly apart on a baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10
                    minutes. The most important piece of advice I can give you is – DO NOT over-bake these chocolate
                    chip cookies! They will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD. At the
                    end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies won't look done but they are. They will look a
                    little doughy when you remove them from the oven, and thats good. They may be lightly browned in a
                    few places, which is exactly how you want them. They will set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for
                    a few minutes. I never bake them for more than 9 minutes.</p>
